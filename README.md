## Overview of Election Audit
We need to help Tom automate the election audit process using python. We get the votes from three sources Mail-In ballots, punch cards, Direct recording electronic counting machines for a particular county and candidate.
In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 
- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
