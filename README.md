# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 

- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
