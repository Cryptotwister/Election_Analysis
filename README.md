## Overview of Election Audit
We need to help Tom automate the election audit process using python. We get the votes from three sources Mail-In ballots, punch cards, Direct recording electronic counting machines for a particular county and candidate.

- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
